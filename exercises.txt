PART I: ARRAY METHODS
1. For the customers above, wirte a function that returns only the customers that are 33 years old or younger and have kids.
[hint: your favorite array method should be "filter"]

2. Write a function that for any customer who doen not have kids, adds an instance: "isFree: true" and for those who have kids, adds "isFree : false".
[hint: you can use either map or forEach. Write it once with map, and once with forEach. Once and forever, understand the difference, you'll be happier through your career.]

3. Find the first customer who dirves a "Stepway".

PART II: MUTABILITY
1. For the first question of part I, before doing the operation, take a backup from the original JSON, and store it in a variable called "theOriginal".
In the end compare the original and the final answer, and make sure that the original has remained intact.
